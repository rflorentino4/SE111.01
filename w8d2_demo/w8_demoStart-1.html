        //[PART 1]-WEEK 7 REVIEW---JS HTML ELEMENT SELECTION-----------------------------
        //selection: select by TAG NAME or #ID
        //below are HTML elements objects that will now be stored in our <script>
            var header = document.querySelector(`#header`)

            var pName = document.getElementById(`player`)
            var pClass = document.getElementById(`p-class`) //in the directions of hw, when she says input & divs, she's referring to all of them + however, when you grab an element it always grabs the first so give everything new names (?)
            var pLevel =document.getElementById(`p-lvl`)

            var submit = document.getElementById(`submit`)

            var resultBox = document.getElementById(`resultBox`)
            //above are all GLOBAL names and both name and values assigned are accessible anywhere in our <script> once declared

            //all of these names now represent OBJECTS - we can access their .properties (attributes) by using dot syntax
            console.log(`The header's ID is: # ${header.id}`)
            header.style.backgroundColor = `#999999`
            
            //adding event listeners: JS requires the an event to occur in order for most functions to "run" - this requires adding an event type listener to elements

            //below prevents refresh of the page when submit button is clicked 
            var form = document.getElementById(`myForm`)
            function handleForm(event) {event.preventDefault()}
            form.addEventListener(`submit`, handleForm) //parameters are values a function NEEDS to do its job -- here its job is to run at event, curly brackets show that event is an object and after the dot is what it is being asked to do
            //to run an eventlistener, put object then what the func you want it to do WITHOUT parenthesis
            //below creates the event listener to run the basicInfo function which runs when the submit button is clicked 
            submit.addEventListener(`click`, basicInfo) //this is quickest way to do it

            //build a function for the event you just created
            //event based functions require the event paramete (event/evnt/ev/e - all work)
            function basicInfo(e) //pName will only show up on console AFTER submit button bc of this
            {
                //gloval names + values are accessible everywhere!
                console.log(pName)

                //access the pName's value 
                console.log(pName.value) // this grabs whatever user ENTERS to pName box 

                //write the plauer's name to the result box using global name notation
                resultBox.innerHTML = `<h6>${pName.value}</h6>`//innerHTML gives you access to the CONTENT within box
            }//basicInfo() CLOSE


        //[PART 2]-INTRO TO JS ARRAYS & OBJECTS-------------------------------------------------------------------------
        //-------ARRAYS--------------------
        //-------create a new array of names and populate it!

        var people = [ //FLAT BRACKETS DENOTE ARRAYS    
        "Katie",
        "Marty",
        "Sal",
        "Jay",
        "Jordan"
        ]

        //using the array name by itself describes the WHOLE SET OF values
        console.log(people) //shows entire array structure (object)
        console.log(`${people}`) //only shows values stored!!

        //aray name +KEY ____ describes ONE VALUE
        console.log(`${people[2]}`) //the 2 will show Sal bc of order, this is how you display specific lines instead of the whole thing

        //everything in JS is an object! so arrays take on array properties whenever built, like the .length - # of values stored to the array 
        console.log(`The 'people' array has ${people.length} values stored to it!`) //arrays always offer length

        //----------------ADDING VALUES TO ARRAYS------------------

        //add a name to the array - requires knowing next available index #
        people[5] = "Tim"

        //add a name to the array - base on length, which reps next available index #
        people[people.length] = "Scott" //people.length returns an integer, .length always represents the NEXT available index #

        //add a name to the array - using the .push() method avaialable to array ttypes
        people.push("Jim")              //.append() in Python" +++ THINK ADDING TO THE END OF THE ARRAY, NEXT ITEMS/PEOPLE HERE

        //people.push(prompt("Enter a name for the array: "))
        console.log(`Now the 'people' array has ${people.length} values.`)




        //-------PARALLEL ARRAYS-----------
        //-------Building a parallel array to people array that holds fave animals

        var faveAnimals = [
            "elephant",                 //this is [0] value, belongs to people[0]
            "dog",
            "birds",
            "jaguar",
            "panda bear",               //this is [4] value, people[4] represents this line
            "meerkat",
            "giraffe",
            "duck"

        ]

        //-----------PROCESSING ARRAYS - use a standard for loop to batch process standard arrays (do the same things to every value in the array)

        //standard for loop- best used for standard arrays - arrays with int index
        for(let index = 0; index < people.length; index++) //for loop exit when index becomes larger than 5
        {
            //BLOCK SCOPE: uses the let declarative: the variable/name is only accessible within the { code block }

            //index++ - post-incrementation, adds +1 to index after each loop interation

            //show the parallel nature of the arrays - display each name value with its corresponding favorite animal
            console.log(`${people[index]}'s fave animal is a(n): ${faveAnimals[index]}`)
            
        }//standard aaray for loop processing close - showing parallel arrays
    

        //-------ASSOCIATIVE ARRAYS---------
        //arrays with string index instead of integer index
        var classTimes = []

        //developer must hand populate each string index with a unique string key
        classTimes["early"] = "7:45A"
        classTimes["better"] = "11:25A"
        classTimes["afternoon"] = "3:05P"
        classTimes["evening"] = "5:45P"

        //for in loops are best used for associative arrays and other string-based keys, like properties in objects
        for (let key in classTimes)
        {
            //"for every key in the classTimes array"

            //display each value stored at each key in the array, with its key as a label
            console.log(`Class Times:${key}: ${classTimes[key]}`)
        }
