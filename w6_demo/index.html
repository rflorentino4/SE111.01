        this is a multi line comment

        //we must DECLARE variables before we can define or use them
        var name //this has now been declared as a variable - we can now use it
        name = "RF" //definition -- assigning data to the name

        //combine the instructions
        var newName = "Romina"

        //in JS, all numbers are just #'s, don't have to declare INT or FLOAT like in PY
        var num1 = 10
        var num2 = 7
        var sum = num1 + num2

        //OUTPUT------------------
        //console.log() -> output for TESTING/DEVELOPMENT/DEBUGGING - NOT for the USER -> console is an object, not for user, for US
        console.log(name)               // one stored value
        console.log(name, newName)      //2 stored values
        //LITERAL STRINGS USE `` and allow for stored value inclusion 
        console.log(`1stNAME:${name} \n2nd NAME: ${newName}`)       //message + stored
        // \n = new line, just like Python

        //alert() -> creates a pop-up; user might interact with (press OK) before next lines of script are read
        alert(`${sum} = ${num1} + ${num2}`)
        console.log(`${sum} = ${num1} + ${num2}`)

        //displays number rounded to the 2nd decimal place -> DOESN'T ACTUALLY ROUND, just DISPLAYS what the 2nd decimal would be
        alert(`SUM TOTAL: $${sum.toFixed(2)}`)          //this method can only be applied to number objects (the fix method) //object is what comes before . -> in this case, sum

        //INPUT-------------------------
        //prompt() -> function that creates a pop-up window which includes a text field for user to enter data -- 
        //user MUST click OK before prompt() will close / any new lines are processed 
        var last = prompt(`Hi ${name}! Enter your last name:`) // this is a function call

        console.log(`passed the prompt()`)
        console.log(`Last Name: ${last}`)

        //gaining numbers from the iser - cast as a number!
        var num = Number(prompt(`Enter a number:`))

        //var multi = num * 10

        console.log(num)              //looks like a number ?
        console.log(num.toFixed(2))   //but is it a number ?  -> in PYTHON 7 = "7" is FALSE, in JAVA, 7 = "7" is TRUE even if # & string, once you start adding more equal signs tho, it changes what its checking for - value, data type, etc. 
        //since we accepted data FROM USER (aka input), num becomes a string
